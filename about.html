      Hello my name is Georgio Munoz, and I'm a 25 year old aspiring business professional looking for an adventure. An insight into who I am and what I'm about varies from my love of traveling and my love for my family and friends. Success is always in my number one focuses. That is why I'm sharing my life and the story it brings. I was born in Newark New Jersey, and eventually raised in Bloomfield New Jersey. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Raised by a single mother and one other brother I learned at an early age to work as a team player. I took that experience and played multiple sports like soccer and tennis. That is where I developed a love for health and outdoors. Ultimately I began my college career by enrolling in Middlesex County College. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the period of time in which I explored both my mental and creative faculties. The ability to think with no clear goals allowed me to develop an independent point of view. Eventually coming to the conclusion that I wanted to study fashion merchandising and retail management. From there I decided to take the next step into NYC by acquiring my bachelors degree in Marketing.
